<h1>PROFILE</h1>

<p>
    Originally from Romania, I decided in my early 20s to build a career based on experiences from different countries and cultures. So far, I've gathered experience in Customer Service
    Administration, and Management, in 3 countries: Romania, Germany and the UK.
</p>
<p>
    I'm creative, proactive, and resourceful, with strong technical, decision making, numerical, analytical, and problem-solving skills. I relish working in a challenging and fast paced environment. The experience gained during the past 
    9 years in the automotive and logistics sector has nourished my passion for Management and Customer Service, 
    which I look forward to further expanding on.

<p>
    Having completed my Bachelor's degree in IT, 15 years ago, I have recently started showing higher interest in this field. To satisfy my curiosity, I'm currently undertaking courses / bootcamps towards becoming a Full Stack Wed Developer. <br/>
